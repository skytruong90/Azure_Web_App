Very basic Azure Resource Manager template that deploys the same VM as created in chapter 2. This example shows how the different Resource Manager components are pieced together to build a VM. You are prompted for the SSH public key, and that's it. This approach makes it quick to deploy VMs in a clean, consistent manner. More values can be changed to parameters that you are prompted for as you deploy.
